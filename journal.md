# Introduction

The file extension .md stands for markdown.
No clue what that means, but we know E. Brown built a time machine [1] in 1985 and used it [2] in 1955.

Simulations are grossly overrated when you have a working time machine, according to E. Brown.

One broken clocktower.
One broken tombstone.
One broken steam engine.
