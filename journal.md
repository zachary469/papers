# Title

This is the new Title with small changes after merging

# Abstract

I think it's very abstract.

# Introduction

The file extension .md stands for markdown.
No clue what that means, but we know E. Brown built a time machine [1] in 1985 and used it [2] in 1955.

# Simulations

Simulations are grossly overrated when you have a working time machine, according to E. Brown.

# Results

One broken clocktower.
One broken tombstone.
One broken steam engine.

# Conclusions

It's not worth trying to build a time machine.

# Figures

Insert photo of whiteboard diagram here.

# Acknowledgments

We'd like to tank the 2015 weather forecast for its precision. Oh, wait. D'oh.
